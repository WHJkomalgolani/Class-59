For loop will work from 0 to 5

Math.random generates a number between 0 and 1, that is not a whole number, and also is not 1.
To get a number, for example between 0 and 10, multiply your answer by 10: Math.random() * 10 .
To get it to be a whole number, i.e. an integer, apply Math.floor, which rounds down to the nearest whole number: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
 To get a whole number between 1 and 10, add 1 to the answer: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1)
